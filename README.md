# Dissertation_CodeFile-Datasets
This repository contains the datasets and the Python code file needed for the analysis.
The folder 'CSR Reports' contains within it company-wise sub folders which have the CSR reports from 2017-22. 

**This folder-sub folder division is essential as the paths in the code file depend on this structure to access data**

The folder also contains the 'SDG_Compass_5Ps' file which contains the sentences extracted from the SDG compass documents for each of the 17 SDGs

**To replicate the results of the analysis **

1. Download the CSR reports folder in this repository and retain its folder structure.
2. The Python file uses Google drive file paths to access data, so directly upload the downloaded folder to your Google Drive
3. Ensure the file paths are referenced correctly in the code cells under the titles of "Extract Text from Report PDFs and store in DFs" and "Sentence Similarity with SDGs"
4. Run the code file.
